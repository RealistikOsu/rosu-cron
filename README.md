# RealistikOsu Cron
The all-in-one cron job for RealistikOsu, carrying out non-immidiate cleanup and related operations.

## What is this?
As the name suggests, it is a cron job made in Python! It has been made to unify all of the tasks into one, simple, effective job. Currently, RealistikOsu is required to utilise 2 different cron jobs in completely different languages, with varying effectiveness.

The required modules and their versions are specified within `requirements.txt`, meaning you only have to run `python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of them. This cron has been made with Python 3.9 in mind, but there is theoritically nothing stopping it from working on versions above 3.5.

## Current Features
The cron job contains a vart variety of jobs, including:
- I just made this repo
- There is currently absolutely nothing.
- Be patient.
